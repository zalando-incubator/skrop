# Packaging

Skrop requires [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips). This directory contains build scripts and a Dockerfile to build a production-ready Docker image that includes the latest libvips version.

In order to build a Docker image, simply run the `build.sh` script or `make docker` from the root directory of the Skrop project.
